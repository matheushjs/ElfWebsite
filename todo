Im thinking of using both react apps and normal js/jquery pages, for learning purposes
We can serve react shit under a directory like /react

The website must have a place where I can share my discoveries. Practicing how to convey knowledge to the outside world is scientific hability

See jekyl and look for other markup / text formatting librariess



Directory organization proposal

/
	index.js # Main serving file
	js/      # Directory containing javascript for the server
	client/  # Client-side files
		html/  # html files
		js/    # javascript/jquery files
		css/   # CSS files
		App1/  # Some react application
			build/  # Location of the react application's bundled html file
			src/    # Source files for the react app
			public/ # Static files for the react app



Directory organization for when the website becomes big:

/
	index.js # Main serving file
	js/      # Directory containing javascript for the server
	users/   # Directory containing user authentication information
	client/  # Root directory of the website
		global/  # Some directory that should never be served
			html/  # Global html files
			css/   # Global css files
			js/    # Global js files

		Blog/  # Directory containing stuff for a section of the website
			documents/  # Documents of the blog
			index.html  # Blog's root html file
			css/        # Any needed css files
			html/       # Any needed html files
			js/         # Any needed javascript file
		
		App1/  # Some react application
			build/  # Location of the react application's bundled html file
			src/    # Source files for the react app
			public/ # Static files for the react app
