      Hello, and welcome to my page!
    </p>
    <p>
      This page was originally supposed to be a playground for me to practice web development,
        but I hope it also serves for publishing information about <strong>myself and my research</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently a <strong>Computer Science</strong> undergraduate student, with research interest in low level aspects of a computer, close to the hardware level.
      In general, however, I like gathering smaller chunks of knowledge on a broad range of areas of Computer Science,
        so that I can face a large number of problems without feeling completely ignorant.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently researching about High-Performance Computing applied to the problem of Protein Structure Prediction.
      Since I've been enjoying to do science, I'm currently arranging things so that I can <strong>research for the rest of my life</strong>.
