Lately, I've started a scientific initiation within the area of high performance computing. Because of that, I'm having to write a research project that formally and scientifically describe what I'm proposing to study in the period of 1 year. Though, I'm having a hard time conveying my thoughts through a written document; it feels like 4 years in the university took away my capability of writing.

This Blog's purpose is merely providing me with a place where I can practice written though conveyance. I plan on writing about subjects of my interest, trying my best to make the text as clear as possible. I don't really expect anyone to read whatever I'll write here, but I'll give my best to write in a way that, if someone ever does read this, they can easily understand what I said.
