      <p>Hello, and welcome to my page! This page is actually supposed to be a playground for me to train my web developing knowledge, but I hope it also does fulfill the purpose of elucidating information about myself.</p>
      <p>I'm currently a Computer Science undergraduate student, with recently acquired interest in low level aspects of a computer, near the hardware level. However, for now I'm mostly interested in gathering smaller chunks of knowledge on all areas of Computer Science, so that I can face any problem without having to feel like I'm ignorant regarding the problem to be faced.</p>
      <p>In 2017 I began a Scientific Initiation in High-Performance Computing applied to the Protein Structure Prediction problem. I hope to use this opportunity to decide whether I'll follow an academic path or not.</p>
